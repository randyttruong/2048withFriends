This game (2048) was built using **React** and **TypeScript**, loosely following a 
tutorial from Mateusz Sokola.   

## Additions

- Added Google Sign-In API support 
- Created API for accessing user scores 
- Added backend functionality for tracking user score using MySQL

### `npm start`

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
